## Environment

### Windows

While not strictly required if you run `git` through IntelliJ, we recommend:

* installing [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) ([video instructions](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6fae1c27-6b37-4b7c-a3b6-b0e201546e2e&start=0))

* pinning Git Bash to the Taskbar and configuring it to open in your preferred directory
([video instructions](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=473e830b-bd18-4e87-a1ab-b0ea017447b5&start=0))

### Mac

Try running `git` from the command line. If it hasn't been installed, you may be prompted to install the
command line developer tools, which you should do. If you get an `xcrun` error, install them manually with
`xcode-select --install` or (if that doesn't work) `sudo xcode-select --reset`.
