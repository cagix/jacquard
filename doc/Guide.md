# Jacquard User Guide

Jacquard-based autograders consist of:
* Java code that makes use of the Jacquard library
* scripts and a configuration file to prepare student submissions to be 
  used with the Java code

## Examples

For complete examples, see:

* [Jacquard Template 1](https://github.com/espertus/jacquard-template1), which
  demonstrates these features, applied to a single submitted file.
  * Checkstyle tests
  * PMD tests
  * Parser-based tests (ensuring that language features are used as required)
  * JUnit tests
